Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: at803x: fix feature detection

AR8031/AR8033 have different status registers for copper
and fiber operation. However, the extended status register
is the same for both operation modes.

As a result of that, ESTATUS_1000_XFULL is set to 1 even when
operating in copper TP mode.

Remove this mode from the supported link modes, as this driver
currently only supports copper operation.
